title: About me
---


I'm Daniela, a Chilean PhD candidate in the Integrative Genetics and Genomics Graduate Group at UC Davis, and a member of the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/).


I'm an engineer turned bioinformatician, passionate about long-read sequencing, great ape structural variation and evolution, omics integration, and reproducible bioinformatics. I've been into digital drawing for several years and I'm open to opportunities to illustrate science related topics and logotype design. 

I would love to meet over coffee/tea to talk about long-reads, great apes, evolution, reproducible bioinformatics, or The Mandalorian.
