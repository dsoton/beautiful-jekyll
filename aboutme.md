Hi

This is Dani. 

Engineer, computational biologist and bioinformatician. I am currently studying a PhD at UC Davis in the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/). 

<sub>I am also a musician (guitar, ukulele, mandolin, charango, voice, production), once-a-week salsa and bachata dancer, sometimes digital and watercolor background artist, ocassionally lettering and logo designer, soon-to-be photographer (I'm learning, ok!) and "cartoonist" (does make cartoons of your lab count?). I love to read. And, in case you are wondering, I am either Revenclaw or Hufflepuff (I receive contradictory results in any test that I have tried. If you know a good and reliable one, please let me know!).</sub>
