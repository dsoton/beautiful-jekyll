title: About me
---

I am an engineer and computational biologist, interested in understanding the effect of genetic variation in human traits and disease, using mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am studying a Ph.D. at UC Davis. I am an advocate for women in STEM.
