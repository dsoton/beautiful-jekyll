title: About me
---


I'm Daniela, a PhD candidate in the Integrative Genetics and Genomics Graduate Group at UC Davis, and a member of the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/). I'm originally from Chile.


I'm an engineer turned bioinformatician, passionate about long-read sequencing, great ape structural variation and evolution, reproducible bioinformatics workflows and Python. In my spare time I draw, play guitar and ukelele, sing, read, write and take care of my plants.
