title: About me
---


I'm Daniela, a Chilean PhD candidate in the Integrative Genetics and Genomics Graduate Group at UC Davis, and a member of the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/).


I'm an engineer turned bioinformatician, passionate about long-read sequencing, great ape structural variation and evolution, omics integration, reproducible bioinformatics workflows. I've been into digital drawing for several years and I'm open to opportunities to illustrate science-related topics and "logo" design. 

I would love to meet over coffee/tea to talk about long-reads, great apes, evolution, reproducible bioinformatics, or The Mandalorian.
