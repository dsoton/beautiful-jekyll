title: About me
---


I'm Daniela, a PhD candidate in the Integrative Genetics and Genomics Graduate Group at UC Davis, and a member of the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/). I'm originally from Chile and got a Fulbright fellowship to study in the US.


I'm an engineer turned bioinformatician, passionate about long-read sequencing, human structural variation, human evolution, reproducible bioinformatics workflows and Python. My dissertation project involves unveiling the variability landscape of human-specific duplicated regions in the genome and their role in human evolution and disease. Outside my dissertation, I work in chimpanzee structural variation and _de novo_ genome assembly, as well as automating bioinformatics workflows with Snakemake. Previously, I worked with RNA-seq and amplicon sequencing data in the [Plants Systems Biology Lab](http://virtualplant.bio.puc.cl/cgi-bin/Lab/index.cgi). In my spare time I play guitar, sing, read and take care of my plants.


This website is my attemp to share my work as well as share some of my bioinformatics pipelines (someone might find them useful).


Thanks for visiting!
